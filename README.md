## PROJECT EDA

Project where I do a descriptive and comparative analysis about the current financial situation of the Spanish Government, especially focussed on accumulated debt. 
In this, the most important macroeconomic indicators are analysed:
- Gross Domestic Product
- Debt/GDP
- Fiscal pressure
- Labour Market

Here are some examples of graphs extracted from the project:
