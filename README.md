# Data-Science-Projects
Repository where I save the projects I'm currently working on and those finished.

## PROJECT MACHINE LEARNING

Project where I do a predictive analysis using machine learning, more concretely using a Random Forest model for predicting the life expectancy in a country just by using three variables: GDP, population and extension of the country.




## PROJECT EDA

Project where I do a **descriptive and comparative analysis** about the current financial situation of the Spanish Government, especially focussed on accumulated debt. 
In this, the most important macroeconomic indicators are analysed:
- Gross Domestic Product
- Debt/GDP
- Fiscal pressure
- Labour Market

Here are some examples of graphs extracted from the project:
